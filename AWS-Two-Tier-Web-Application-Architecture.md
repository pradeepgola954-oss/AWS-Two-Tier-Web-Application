► I created a MySQL user named Prince that can connect from any host (%) and set a secure password for it.

**SSH Command:**

```bash
CREATE USER 'Prince'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'Pradeep@123';
```
► I gave the new user full access to myDatabase and refreshed the permissions.

```bash
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON myDatabase.* TO 'Prince'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
# Step 12: Verifying Permissions and Table Status

► I checked the new user's permissions to make sure everything was set up correctly.

```bash
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'Prince'@'%';
```
► Finally, I ran a test query to make sure the guestbook table was ready to store data.

```bash
SELECT * FROM guestbook;
```
